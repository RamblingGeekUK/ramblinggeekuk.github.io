<h3>Wayne T Taylor</h3>

<p>I‚Äôve always been fascinated with technology from a young age.  I got given my first computer when I was around 11 years old and it‚Äôs continued from there through to the Spectrum, Commodore, x86 and beyond.</p>
<p>I managed to land a job at the local computer shop, The COMPSHOP.  I worked there from the age of 14 to 18.</p>
<p>I then moved on to another local company, Parity Computers Ltd, who installed networks, Novell 3.11, 4.1, Windows NT 4.0, Windows Server 2000, Windows Server 2003,  I worked here for a little over 9 years.</p>
<p>Myself and a friend started our own company in 2005, Total ICT Limited. Installing and maintaining computer networks. In late August 2010, we sold Total ICT Limited and as part of the sale agreement I was contracted to remain at the company for the following 12 months.</p>
<p>I‚Äôm a self taught programmer and have wrote various utilities and applications over the years and continue to dabble.</p>
<p>I now work for a IT company based in Chester, CNS IT Ltd.</p>

<h3>Kryptos</h3>

<p>I first came across the word kryptos in a children‚Äôs book about cryptography, the explanation was the following:
Kryptos is the Greek word for ‚Äúhidden‚Äù, and the root of other words such as cryptography, encryption and cryptic.
See the Wikipedia Article for information regarding the kryptos sculpture out side of the CIA in Langley Virginia, USA.  I‚Äôve owned the domain since around 1996 on wards.
Dan Browns last book, The Lost Symbol make‚Äôs reference to the Kryptos. I didn‚Äôt enjoy the read. üôÇ </p>

<h3>Rambling Geek</h3>

<p>I purchase the domain for this blog in September 2009.  I didn‚Äôt feel kryptos was the right fit.  The only aim for this blog  is to use it as sort of a online notebook, ideas, things that I‚Äôve seen and may want to share with people I know.  If you find anything here useful then great.</p>  Please leave a comment.
